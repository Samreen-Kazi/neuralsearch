A Question Answering (QA) system aims at satisfying users who are looking to answer a specific question in natural language.

It works like search engines, but with different result representations: a search engine returns a list of links to answering resources, while a QA system gives a direct answer to a question.

The information-retrieval process in QA systems is broken down into three stages: question processing, ranking, and answer extraction.

This is a semantic search engine powered by SentenceTransformers with a retrieval and reranking system on Wikipedia corous. 

This will return the top 5 results.
